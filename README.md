# SQDM-Dirtbikes
A VU Mod to replace the BMP/LAV with Dirtbikes in Squad DeathMatch maps!

# Release 1.0.0
This MOD is now working with the 25 Squad DeathMatch Maps listed here:

- Grand Bazaar
- Noshahr Canals
- Teheran Highway
- Caspian Border
- Seine Crossing
- Operation Firestorm
- Damavand Peak
- Kharg Island
- Operation Metro
- Strike at Karkand
- Gulf of Oman
- Sharqi Peninsula
- Wake Island
- Bandar Desert
- Alborz Mountains
- Armored Shield
- Death Valley
- Markaz Monolith
- Azadi Palace
- Epicenter
- Talah Market
- Operation Riverside
- Nebandan Flats
- Kiasar Railroad
- Sabalan Pipeline

# What does the MOD actually do?
The MOD recognises when one of the above Squad Deathmatch maps are loaded on the server and will then:

- Remove the BMP/LAV spawns from the map.
- Spawn two groups of 4 Dirtbikes at opposite sides of the map.

# Known Issues
- On most maps the VU Client crashes when you quit the game. I'm looking at ways to try and fix this.

# Notes:
The Close Quarters Squad Deathmatch maps are excluded, they are too small to have Dirtbikes running around.

# Thanks!
This MOD was based on an original script by Janssent (https://github.com/J4nssent), who also helped me get to grips with how VU stores its data so massive thanks to him!
