# SQDM-Dirtbikes
A VU Mod to replace the BMP/LAV in Squad DeathMatch maps with Dirtbikes!

# Currently a Work in Progress
I am still working on this MOD and there are more maps to get working but there are 12 working so far:

- Grand Bazaar
- Noshahr Canals
- Teheran Highway
- Caspian Border
- Seine Crossing
- Operation Firestorm
- Damavand Peak
- Kharg Island
- Operation Metro
- Strike at Karkand
- Gulf of Oman
- Sharqi Peninsula

Use at your own risk until I can get this released. ;-)

# What does the MOD actually do?
The MOD recognises when a Squad Deathmatch map is loaded on the server and will then:

- Remove the BMP/LAV spawns from the map.
- Spawn two groups of 4 Dirtbikes at opposite sides of the map.

# Known Issues
- On most maps the VU Client crashes when you quit the game. I'm looking at ways to try and fix this.

# Note:
The Close Quarters Squad Deathmatch maps are excluded, they are too small to have Dirtbikes running around.

# Thanks!
This MOD was based on an original script by Janssent (https://github.com/J4nssent), who also helped me get to grips with how VU stores its data so massive thanks to him!
