# SQDM-Dirtbikes
A VU Mod to replace the BMP/LAV in all of the Squad DeathMatch maps with Dirtbikes!

# Currently a Work in Progress
I have only just started work on this MOD and there are many more maps to get working but there are 2 working so far.

Use at your own risk until I can get this released. ;-)

# What does the MOD actually do?
The MOD recognises when a Squad Deathmatch map is loaded on the server and will then:

- Remove the BMP/LAV spawns from the map.
- Spawn two groups of 4 Dirtbikes at opposite sides of the map.

#Note:
The Close Quarters Squad Deathmatch maps are excluded, they are too small to have Dirtbikes running around.
